# Artificial Neuroplasticity

The brain has a remarkable ability to rewire itself under the right conditions, known as [plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity). This includes, among other processes, [synaptogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptogenesis) (the formation of new synapses), [synaptic pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning) (the removal of synapses), [neurogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis) (the formation of new neurons), and [programmed cell death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death#Role_in_the_development_of_the_nervous_system) (the removal of neurons), all of which have been shown to play prominent roles during various parts of neural development. 

We provide the following code functionality to mirror these processes. All leave the input network(s) unmodified.
